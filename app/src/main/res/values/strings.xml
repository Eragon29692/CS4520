    <string name="about_text">\
This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.
